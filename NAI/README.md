## NAI – Artificial Intelligence Classes

A collection of Java programs showcasing core machine learning concepts:

-  **k-NN Classifier** – Classify data points based on closest neighbors.
-  **Single and Multi-Class Perceptrons** – Binary and multi-class classification.
-  **Precision/Recall/F-Score** – Evaluation metrics for classification models.
-  **Decision Tree RSS** – Calculate Residual Sum of Squares for regression splits.
-  **Centroid Calculation** – Find mean vectors for clustering algorithms.

These projects explore classic AI techniques and metrics for educational purposes.
