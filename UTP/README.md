All 3 projects I completed for UTP (Universal Programming Techniques) classes.

### Main Technologies Used:

- **Java** – Core programming language for all application logic and user interfaces.
- **Java Swing** – GUI framework for building desktop interfaces in the checkers and modeling framework projects[3][4][9].
- **Sockets/Networking** – Enables real-time client-server communication in the chat application.
- **JNI (Java Native Interface)** – Integrates native C code for board logic in the checkers project.
- **Groovy** – Scripting language for extending and customizing model behavior in the modeling framework[2][10].
- **JUnit** – Unit testing framework used for verifying logic and rules.
