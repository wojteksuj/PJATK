## 🧩 UTP – Universal Programming Techniques Projects

This section highlights three Java-based projects developed during the **UTP (Universal Programming Techniques)** course, each focusing on a different aspect of software development, from GUI design and native code integration to real-time networking and scripting.

---

### 🚀 Main Technologies Used

- ☕ **Java** – Core language for application logic and UI handling
- 🪟 **Java Swing** – Used to build interactive desktop interfaces (e.g., checkers game, modeling tool)
- 🔌 **Sockets / Networking** – Powers the real-time client-server chat application
- ⚙️ **JNI (Java Native Interface)** – Allows integration of native C code for performance-critical logic in the checkers game
- 🌀 **Groovy** – Embedded scripting support for dynamic model customization in the modeling framework
- 🧪 **JUnit** – Used to test business logic and enforce correctness of rules and components

🛠️ *Each of these projects demonstrates practical implementation of programming concepts covered in UTP, including GUI development, native integration, concurrent networking, and scripting extensibility.*
